WIC Mobile Application
WIC is the USDA’s special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children.
There is a great need for a functional, easy-to-use mobile application for participants of the WIC
program in the city of York, particularly those of the Haitian-Creole community.

The Hack
Create a mobile application that allows WIC recipients to visually identify items that are covered under
the program, scan items in store, and receive feedback visually and audibly of whether the scanned item
is covered, and why or why not, or at least offering an alternative (identify if a smaller or larger size of
an item is covered instead of the item selected).
A Grand Prize in the amount of $800 will be awarded to the group that is best able to solve the problem.

Here is how the process currently works:
• A printed list of items approved for purchase with a WIC card are provided at each appointment in
English (Picture 1).
o The items are listed by amount, but the measurement tool varies. It can be in ounces, pounds,
jar (with specific ounces), or cash amount.
o Often the ounce approved does not match the product packaging size, and the correct brand
and packaging must be chosen to qualify.
o Food items are restricted by brand and flavor, and the flavors are not the same across the
brands approved.
o Amounts approved are for 1 month.
▪ If not used, the funds do not roll over to the next month.
o After each shopping transaction a paper receipt is printed that shows remaining quantities of
items available for that month.
• Examples:
o Approved Cereals can be combined but ounces can’t exceed the approved amount.
▪ Approved packaging ranges from 9.8 oz to 36 ounces with a 72-ounce maximum
approved per month.
o 6 half gallons of milk are approved, but 3-gallon containers of milk are not covered, therefore,
you cannot combine two, 3-gallon containers to qualify.
o Only 16-ounce packages of bread are covered.

There is an existing app, but it is hard to use and unintuitive:
• When using the app in Creole language, the information provided on funds available is
provided in English (Picture 2 and 3)
• When items are scanned to check if WIC is approved, it indicates the item is not covered but
does not indicate why is not covered or offer an alternative product.
For example, if you scan a gallon of milk, it is not covered but a 1⁄2 gallon is covered.
Cultural Challenges
• English is second language, or they lack English proficiency to ask for help at the grocery store.
• Embarrassed that they don’t understand the rules.
• While they speak Haitian-Creole, they may not be literate in their language. Written resources
in their language may not be fully accessible.
